# How to use generative AI systems 

This tutorial is designed to guide Data Science students at Musashino University, Japan, on how to utilize generative AI systems such as Bing.com with ChatGPT-4 and Gemini.

Generative AI systems for dialogue can be broadly classified into two categories: online interactive dialogue AI, which operates via a browser, and terminal command AI, which operates in a batch style. Each type of terminal command AI requires specific settings for use, yet they are all available at no cost.

This repository provides an introduction to four distinct types of dialogue AI systems: Bing.com of Copilot via Edge (ChatGPT-4), and EdgeGPT without a browser, and Google Gemini (with and without a browser). It's worth noting that EdgeGPT is built upon the ChatGPT-4 framework: https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Confirmed-the-new-Bing-runs-on-OpenAI%E2%80%99s-GPT-4

The following two links are online interactive dialog AI systems via browser for free of charge:

Gemini via any browser: https://gemini.google.com/

Bing.com via Edge browser using ChatGPT-4: https://bing.com/copilot

<b>
You need to practice interacting with the AI to accomplish the desired tasks. Practice makes perfect.
It is important for users to be aware that generative AI may produce inaccurate responses due to insufficient training or the presence of incorrect data. The validity and usefulness of this tutorial on generative AI have been confirmed by published peer-reviewed journal articles. These articles attest to the tutorial's accuracy.

Answer from AI:

hiscovid for visualizing and identifying when policymakers made mistakes against COVID-19

This paper presents a new tool called hiscovid that can be used to visualize and identify when policymakers made mistakes against COVID-19. hiscovid uses a time-series policy outcome scoring tool to evaluate the outcomes of COVID-19 policies by country. The daily cumulative population mortality is used for scoring the outcomes of COVID-19 country policies. hiscovid allows policymakers to observe the progress and transition of scores over time to learn lessons from the past decision-making mistakes for correcting the current policies to reduce unnecessary deaths.

Review of hikikomori: A global health issue, identification and treatment

This paper reviews the literature on hikikomori, a Japanese term for a condition in which people withdraw from social contact and isolate themselves in their homes for extended periods of time. Hikikomori is a global health issue, with an estimated 1.5 million people in the United States and 1.2 million people in Europe affected by the condition. The paper discusses the identification and treatment of hikikomori, and provides recommendations for future research.

<b>32.****While Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are pollutants that can harm human health, they can also produce ozone (O3) when radiated by the sun. This ozone, known as ground-level ozone, plays a significant role in our atmosphere. In the tropics, ozone ascends to the upper atmosphere through a process called the Brewer-Dobson circulation. If we could develop new technology to mitigate the tropopause—the boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere—we might be able to enhance the thickness of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, potentially offering greater protection against skin cancer. The creation of such technology would be a testament to human ingenuity, turning a negative phenomenon into a beneficial one. Let’s brainstorm some ideas for this new technology.

<b>33.**The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was shared, in two equal parts, between the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (founded in 1988) and United States former vice president, Al Gore. In 2021, the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to scientists Syukuro Manabe of the United States and Klaus Hasselmann of Germany for work that laid the foundation for current climate models. Numerous studies have highlighted the significant role of human-induced CO2 emissions in contributing to global warming. However, the COVID-19 lockdowns have led to a substantial reduction in these emissions. Specifically, during the peak of the lockdowns, human-induced CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 60%. To gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, it is crucial to examine relevant datasets and discern the truth. During the lockdowns, NOAA datasets suggest that global CO2 emissions including natural and human-induced CO2 increased.

If one is different, we don't know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. The balance may be used three times to determine if there is a unique (counterfeit or fake) coin to isolate it and determine its weight relative to the others.

# Terminal command AI with ChatGPT

trans.py with ChatGPT-3 is an example of translation from English to French and Japanese.
The text message "Translate this into 1. French and 2. Japanese:\n\nWhat rooms do you have available?\n." is fed to openai to generate the response.

<pre>
1.API key:
https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
open account to obtain API key for OpenAI

2. $ pip install openai

3. $ cat trans.py
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import openai

openai.api_key ="API-key"

res = openai.Completion.create(
  model="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Translate this into 1. French and 2. Japanese:\n\nWhat rooms do you have available?\n.",
  temperature=0.3,
  max_tokens=100,
  top_p=1.0,
  frequency_penalty=0.0,
  presence_penalty=0.0
)
print(res['choices'][0]['text'])

4. $ python trans.py
1. Quels salles avez-vous disponibles?
2. どの部屋が利用可能ですか？

</pre>

# Exercises
1. Interacting with ChatGPT generates a program (ask.py) in Python for interactively asking user's question and the temperature setting with ChatGPT and returning the response.

Hint: The temperature is a determinant of randomness from 0.0 to 1.0 to control the randomness. The larger the temperature, the greater the randomness.

2. Create a english-to-japanese translator in Python by ChatGPT.

3. Create a program to collect a list of peer-reviewed papers on the specific subject given from a user.


# EdgeGPT from terminal command
EdgeGPT takes advantage of the new version of Bing (Microsoft search engine)
with ChatGPT-4.0. The installation of EdgeGPT is detailed as follows.

1. $ pip install EdgeGPT

2. Install the latest Edge browser.

3. With Edge, open https://bing.com/chat site.

4. Install Cookie-Editor for Edge.

5. Make sure accessing bing.com with Edge.

6. From Extensions, click Cookie-Editor
<img src='fig1.png' height=400 width=300>

7. Click Export icon of Cookie-Editor
<img src='fig2.png' height=300 width=300>

This will copy the cookie to clipboard.

8. Paste the clipboard to the cookies.json file.

9. Run the following program.
<pre>
import asyncio
from EdgeGPT import Chatbot

async def main():
    bot = Chatbot(cookie_path='cookies.json')
    print(await bot.ask("who is yoshiyasu takefuji?"))
    await bot.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
</pre>

# Exercise
0. Make sure cookie-editor in edge browser showing your cookies, not empty. To show the content of cookie-editor, after logging into your Microsoft account at the Edge, you will need to access bing.com.

1. Write a program (edge.py) for interactively asking a question to EdgeGPT and returning the response.

2. Give the text of "solve x +  y = 3 and 2 x + y = 2, and verify it" to your program until the answer shows the right answer of x and y.

HINT: 
If you have incorrect results, conversation_style must be set in your program.

3. Give the following text "show email for yoshiyasu takefuji" to show the right email address.

4. Write a program in Python to collect a list of peer-reviewed papers on the specific subject.

5. Compare the performance between ChatGPT-3 and EdgeGPT about the above problem.

# Google search console API example
The Google search capability for the latest information can be used with AI to strengthen the wiser system.

1. Create your Google Cloud account and enable custom search to obtain your unique API key.
https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager

2. Enable custom search service. To obtain Google CSE ID, access to https://cse.google.com.

<pre>
from googleapiclient.discovery import build
import json

GOOGLE_CSE_ID='your unique cx'
GOOGLE_API_KEY='enabled search API KEY'
API_SERVICE_NAME = 'searchconsole'

def gsearch(keyword, num=10):
    search_service = build("customsearch","v1",developerKey=GOOGLE_API_KEY)
    response = search_service.cse().list(
                q=keyword,
                cx=GOOGLE_CSE_ID,
                lr='lang_en',
                num=num,
                start=1
            ).execute()
    res = json.dumps(response, ensure_ascii=False, indent=4)    print(res)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    keyword = input("enter your question: ")
    gsearch(keyword)
</pre>

# Exercise
1. Run the above code.

2. Create a new application with combining Google search API and EdgeGPT API.

# Bard by Google via browser
Access to https://bard.google.com/

1. ask "who is yoshiyasu takefuji with a google search command "yoshiyasu takefuji".

2. ask "who is yoshiyasu takefuji with a google phrase search command "yoshiyasu takefuji".

3. ask 'use google search with a search phrase command "yoshiyasu takefuji" and find who is yoshiyasu takefuji.'

4. use the google search phrase-site-command with "yoshiyasu takefuji site:nih.gov" and show the result of publications published after 2021 with single-authored as many as possible and verify them with obtained DOIs respectively.

5. make a new interesting application with Bard.

# BARD from terminal line command

1. Access to https://bard.google.com/ with Chrome and use cookie-editor to get "__Secure-1PSID".

2. export BARD_QUICK="true"

3. export BARD_SESSION= <value of "__Secure-1PSID">

4. pip install GoogleBard

5. run the following command on terminal:

$ python -m Bard "use google phrase search with 'yoshiyasu takefuji' and find who is yoshiyasu takefuji?"

# Exercises
1. Interacting with ChatGPT, Bing.com or EdgeGPT, and Bard respectively makes a cookie editor 
in Python for Chrome on your operating system to show all information of cookies and extract 
the value of "__Secure-1PSID".

2. Compare their performance.

3. Solve it: x + y = 3 and 2 x + y = 2.

4. Make an exciting application in Python with interacting generative AI such as ChatGPT, bing.com or EdgeGPT, or Bard. All conversations with the AI should be noted and the conversations will be included in the comments before the generated program. The new and exciting features of the result generated by your program using generative AI should be clearly stated.

Hints: 

A. Understanding text in English with ChatGPT-4 is 85.5% while one in Japanese is 79.9%.

B. You need to choose right words and phrases in dialog with AI (ChatGPT-3, bing.com with ChatGPT-4 and Bard). Add extra words and/or phrases in your dialog.

C. Multiple conversations may be necessary.
